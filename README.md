# Weather-Data_Analysis_for_Agricultural_Productivity
Predict the impact of weather conditions on agricultural productivity. Use weather and agricultural data from multiple sources to build a predictive model that estimates crop yields based on various weather parameters like temperature, rainfall, humidity, etc

Project Overview:
Data Collection (Extract):
1. Weather Data: Extract weather data from APIs such as OpenWeatherMap, NOAA, or any other relevant source that provides historical weather data.
Agricultural Data: Obtain agricultural productivity data, which could include crop yield rates, planting and harvest dates, and crop types from agricultural datasets available on platforms like Kaggle or government databases.
2. Data Preprocessing (Transform):
Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct errors in both weather and agricultural datasets.
Integration: Merge weather and agricultural data based on dates and geographical locations to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Generate new features that could influence agricultural productivity, such as accumulated rainfall over specific periods, average temperature during critical growth stages, and so on.
3. Data Loading (Load):
Store the transformed and cleaned data in a structured format, suitable for analysis. Depending on the project's scale, this could range from a simple CSV file to a more robust database system like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or a cloud-based solution.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Perform statistical analysis and visualization to understand patterns and relationships within the data.
5. Model Development:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Implement linear regression to predict crop yields based on weather conditions. Consider using multiple linear regression if there are multiple relevant features.
6. Model Evaluation and Optimization:
Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics (e.g., R-squared, RMSE).
Optimize the model through feature selection, regularization techniques, or trying different algorithms if linear regression doesn't perform well.
7. Visualization and Insights:
Visualize the relationship between weather conditions and crop yields.
Draw insights and make recommendations for agricultural planning and risk management.
8. Documentation and Deployment:
Document the ETL process, model development, and evaluation steps thoroughly.
Optionally, create a dashboard or an interactive application to visualize the data and predictions, using tools like Dash or Streamlit.

# Prepare
1. Set Up Your Project Environment:
Create a new repository on GitHub for your project. Include a detailed README file explaining the project's purpose, datasets used, and instructions for setting up and running the project.
Decide on the tools and languages you'll use. Python is highly recommended due to its extensive ecosystem of data science libraries (like Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and scikit-learn for modeling).
2. Begin with ETL Processes:
Extract: Research and select your sources for weather and agricultural data. APIs like OpenWeatherMap offer extensive weather data, while agricultural data might be available from government databases or research institutions.
Transform: Clean and preprocess the data using Pandas or similar libraries. This includes handling missing values, normalizing the data, and merging datasets based on common keys (e.g., dates and locations).
Load: Choose a storage solution for the processed data. For simplicity, a CSV file might suffice. For larger datasets or more complex projects, consider a database like PostgreSQL.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis:
Use visualization libraries to explore the data and find patterns or relationships. This step is crucial for understanding your data and guiding the modeling process.
4. Model Development and Evaluation:
Implement linear regression models using scikit-learn or another ML library. Start simple, then iterate and refine your model based on performance metrics.
